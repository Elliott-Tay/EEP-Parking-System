# EEP-OS-Parking-System

## Description
The purpose of this project is to be the software side that manages the carpark system in the parking booth and it is meant to be a local repo that runs at each carpark from handling deduction to be the dashboard that will check what things are going on. We will think of adding a cloud version hosted on something like AWS to probably deal and manage all of the computers remotely.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js as it has easier routing compared to Next.js as Next.js is also server side rendering. CSS tailwind for styling and UI/UX portion of this.

- Backend: Node.js as it is easier for I/O threading, easy to scaffold and maintain compared to Django as Django comes with "battery packs" like authentication and an admin panel which we will not need.
